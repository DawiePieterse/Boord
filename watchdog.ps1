# Boord - watchdog: make sure the servers on this PC are actually answering,
# and restart the ones that are not.
#
# Run every 5 minutes via a Scheduled Task (set up by setup_watchdog.bat).
#
# Why this exists. Every app here is registered as "/sc onstart" - Windows
# starts it at boot and then never looks at it again. If uvicorn exits at
# 11:00 (an unhandled error, a bad update, Windows reclaiming memory), the
# task simply ends and nothing brings it back until somebody reboots the PC.
# On a pack house floor that is a morning of paper.
#
# This is NOT the same job as heartbeat.ps1. That one tells an outside
# service the server is alive so a human gets an email when it is not; it
# never touches the server. This one is the local half: it notices and puts
# the server back. They are complementary and both should be registered -
# a watchdog cannot report a PC that is switched off.
#
# What counts as "up": the port answers HTTP at all. Any status code - 200,
# 404, even 500 - means uvicorn is serving and this script leaves it alone.
# Only a refused connection or a timeout is treated as down. Restarting a
# server because one endpoint returns 500 would take a working pack house
# offline to fix a bug that a restart cannot fix.
